## About

This is a reverse engineered clone of Super Mario World.

It reimplements all parts of the original game and a bunch of mods added by Lunar Magic. The game is playable from start to end.

You need a copy of the ROM to extract game resources (levels, images). Then once that's done, the ROM is no longer needed.

It uses the PPU and DSP implementation from [LakeSnes](https://github.com/elzo-d/LakeSnes), but with lots of speed optimizations.

## Building

./c

## How it Works?
It runs an emulated version in the background and compares the ram state every frame. If it detects a mismatch, it saves a snapshot in saves/ and displays a counter on screen counting down from 300. Please submit these bug snapshots on discord so that they can be fixed.

## Usage and controls

The game supports snapshots. The joypad input history is also saved in the snapshot. It's thus possible to replay a playthrough in turbo mode to verify that the game behaves correctly.
